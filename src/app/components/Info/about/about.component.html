    <p class="my-2">The Sterling Stage Kampitheater is a venue like no other. Beautiful evergreens create a cozy campground and backdrop for the incredible music that takes place on 2 unique stages. A great place to enjoy with old friends and a fun place to meet new ones. Grills and coolers are permitted, dogs require a ticketed pass (no glass, or fireworks please!!!) and all tickets (including day passes) include overnight camping. The Sterling Stage is nestled in picturesque upstate NY near Lake Ontario and other great tourist stops.</p>
